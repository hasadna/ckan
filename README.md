# The Public Knowledge Workshop CKAN

This is a fork of  [CKAN](http://ckan.org/) with updated translations (Hebrew / Arabic) and fixes for RTL languages.

See the [CKAN Documentation](http://docs.ckan.org) for installation and usage instructions.

The `master` branch is started from a stable tagged CKAN version, and changes are applied to it.

See the commits log for details of applied changes and the CKAN version it was based on.
